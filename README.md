# Implementation Plan

Divide into blocks of action, movement, conversation, monologue.

Keep track of current location of protagonist and what kinds of things would be there
(sand, coconuts, palm trees, huts, animals) and things that are there (props, keys,
characters) and pepper them into descriptions.

Go through your writing and classify sentences and paragraphs in terms of what they're
doing.

Include both "do nothing" sentences (things that don’t advance the story, like "x
straigthened/tidied up y", describing weather, describing location, describing people
who haven’t been described yet, describing whatever) and "do something" sentences.
